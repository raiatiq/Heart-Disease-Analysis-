# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Dashboard
An interactive Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard that visualizes key health indicators like age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain, and ECG results. It highlights risk patterns, compares demographics, and provides insights for early detection, prevention, and data-driven healthcare decisions.


ðŸ”‘ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Total Patients Analyzed â€“ Total number of patient records in the dataset.
2. Heart Disease Prevalence (%) â€“ Percentage of patients diagnosed with heart disease.
3. Age Group Distribution â€“ Breakdown of cases across different age groups.
4. Gender-wise Heart Disease Ratio â€“ Comparison of male vs. female patients affected.
5. Cholesterol & Blood Pressure Trends â€“ Relationship between cholesterol/BP levels and heart disease.
6. Chest Pain Type Analysis â€“ Distribution of heart disease cases across different chest pain types.
7. Survival / Risk Rate â€“ Estimated probability of survival or risk of developing heart disease.



ðŸ“ˆ Insights

Age Impact: Patients aged 50+ showed significantly higher risk.

Gender Difference: Heart disease prevalence was higher among males compared to females.

Cholesterol & BP: Patients with high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure had a greater likelihood of heart disease.

Chest Pain Type: Asymptomatic patients showed the highest risk, while typical angina patients had the lowest.

Exercise-Induced Angina & ECG: Abnormal ECG results combined with exercise-induced angina nearly doubled the risk.



âœ… Conclusion

The dashboard highlights that:

Lifestyle factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, exercise) are strongly linked with heart disease.

Preventive measures such as a healthy diet, physical activity, and regular health checkups can significantly reduce risk.

Males and older age groups fall into the high-risk category, requiring closer monitoring.

Data-driven healthcare insights can help in early detection and better treatment planning
